Completing a postdoc in Cryptology at the *<a href='https://www.cwi.nl/en/'>Centrum Wiskunde en Informatica (CWI)</a>*, I defended my PhD at the *<a href='https://www.ens.psl.eu/'>école normale supérieure</a>* (ENS) of Paris in 2024, advised by Pr. <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/david.pointcheval/index.php">David Pointcheval</a>.

I was previously a Research Engineer in the Polynomial Systems (<a href="https://www-polsys.lip6.fr/">PolSys</a>) team of the <a href="https://www.lip6.fr/">LIP6</a> Computer Science Department of Sorbonne université (Paris). I studied General Engineering and Data Science at the *<a href="https://www.ec-lyon.fr/">école Centrale</a>* of Lyon, after two years of *<a href="https://www.stanislas.fr/unite-pedagogique/classes-preparatoires/filieres/cpge-scientifiques/">classes préparatoires</a>* in Maths, Physics and Engineering.
Before my PhD, I have worked on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to produce cloud databases with <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sidonie-Lefebvre">Sidonie Lefebvre</a> at the French National Aerospace Lab (<a href="https://www.onera.fr/en">ONERA</a>) in Palaiseau, and on Data Mining an Processing with <a href="https://ch.linkedin.com/in/didierorel">Didier Orel</a> at <a href="https://www.tamedia.ch/fr/">Tamedia</a> in Lausanne, namely working on the <a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/pages/credits">Paradise Papers</a> in partnership with the <a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/">ICIJ</a>.

My research interests are focused on post-quantum Cryptology and protocols with advanced functionalities, with works on lattice Cryptanalysis, Traceable Receipt-Free Encryption, Verifiable Computations on Homomorphic Ciphertexts, Functional Encryption, Registration-Based Encryption and Key-Encapsulation Mechanisms. I have also worked on Technical Specifications for post-quantum Cryptography at the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (<a href="https://www.etsi.org/">ETSI</a>) during my PhD on behalf of <a href="https://cosmian.com/">Cosmian</a>.
